<h1>Welcome to debexpo</h1>

<p>Debexpo is a web app where::</p>

<ul>
<li>Package maintainers can upload source packages, so that they can be reviewed by "Sponsors"</li>
<li>Sponsors (Debian developers) can review packages and provide feedback.
</ul>

<p>Once you upload packages, you should usually send an email to
the Debian mentors mailing list indicating that you want someone
to review your work. See also
<a href="http://www.debian.org/doc/developers-reference/new-maintainer.html#mentors">Section
2.2 of the New Maintainer's Guide</a>.</p>

<p>You can <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/Debexpo">read more about debexpo on the Debian Wiki</a>.</p>

<p>You can also get directly with the debexpo team. Asheesh Laroia and
Andrey Rahmatullin are the main people involved. For now, the best way to reach
them is by emailing the debexpo development list. You can find information
about that on the Debian wiki page above.</p>

<p>debexpo has had a long history. Andrey (wRAR) and Asheesh (paulproteus) are bringing it back,
and we need help. We hope you'll hang out in #debexpo on irc.debian.org
and chat with us.</p>
