{% extends "email-base.html" %}{% block content %}Hello,

There was a failure in importing your package "{{ args.error.changes.source }}" into
the repository. The problem appears to be in the repository software
and not your package.

Sorry for the inconvenience. The administrator has been notified.
Please try again soon.

The error was:

{{ args.error.error }}

{{ args.error.details }}


Thanks,{% endblock %}
