{% extends "email-base.html" %}{% block content %}Hi.

Your upload of the package '{{ args.upload.package.name }}' to {{ args.settings.SITE_NAME}} was
successful. Others can now see it. The URL of your package is:

    {{ args.upload.package.get_url }}

The respective dsc file can be found at:

    {{ args.upload.get_dsc_url }}

If you do not yet have a sponsor for your package you may want to go to:

    {{ args.upload.get_rfs_url }}

and set the "Seeking a sponsor" option to highlight your package on the
welcome page.

You can also send an RFS (request for sponsorship) to the debian-mentors
mailing list. Your package page will give your suggestions on how to
send that mail.

Good luck in finding a sponsor!

Thanks,{% endblock %}
