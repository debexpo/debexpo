<h3>{% trans 'What is the Debian policy?' %}</h3>

<p>
    {% blocktrans trimmed %}
    Every package must comply with the
    <a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-scope.html">Debian
    policy</a> before it can enter the Debian distribution. This is a
    document which describes the structure and contents of the Debian archive
    and several design issues of the operating system, as well as technical
    requirements that each package must satisfy to be included in the
    distribution.
    {% endblocktrans %}
</p>

<p>
    {% blocktrans trimmed %}
    The policy is not a tutorial. Its a technical manual which specifies
    normative requirements of packages. Read it to learn package specifications.
    If you don't know how to package something for Debian, please read
    additionally the
    <a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/maint-guide/">New Maintainer's
    Guide</a>.
    {% endblocktrans %}
</p>

<h3>{% trans 'Is my package technically okay?' %}</h3>

<p>
    {% blocktrans with site_name=settings.SITE_NAME trimmed %}
    When you upload your package to {{ site_name }} it will automatically be
    checked for common mistakes. You will get an information email after the
    upload. Either your package contains bugs and will be rejected, or the
    package is clean except for some minor technical issues.  You will get hints
    about how to fix the package. If the email tells you that your package is
    fine then a sponsor will still do further checks. Don't worry too much. If
    your package is accepted by mentors.debian.net then let the sponsor help you
    with the rest.
    {% endblocktrans %}
</p>

<h3>{% trans 'What is Lintian?' %}</h3>

<p>
    {% blocktrans trimmed %}
    Lintian is a Debian package checker (and available as
    <a href="https://packages.debian.org/lintian">Debian package</a> so you can
    run it yourself). It can be used to check binary and source packages for
    compliance with the Debian policy and for other common packaging errors.
    {% endblocktrans %}
</p>

<p>
    {% blocktrans trimmed %}
    Packaging for Debian is rather complex because one has to consider hundreds
    of guidelines to make the package "policy compliant". Lintian tries to
    address this issue by providing an automated static analysis framework. You
    can learn more about Lintian in the
    <a href="https://lintian.debian.org/manual/index.html">Lintian User's
    Manual</a>.

<h3>{% trans 'Why do I not receive a confirmation email?' %}</h3>

<p>
    {% blocktrans with email=settings.SUPPORT_EMAIL trimmed %}
    First make sure that you signed the package with the proper PGP key. Next
    check where you uploaded your package. By default the dput and dupload tools
    upload to Debian's official FTP master server. That server will silently
    drop your upload. If the problem persist please send an email to <strong>
    Site email</strong>:
    <a href="mailto: {{ email }}">{{ email }}</a> if you require assistance.
    {% endblocktrans %}
</p>

<h3>{% trans 'My binary packages do not show up' %}</h3>

<p>
    {% blocktrans with site_name=settings.SITE_NAME trimmed %}
    The current policy on {{ site_name }} is to deliberately throw away the
    binary packages. This is done for two main reasons. First, it saves a lot of
    disk space. And second, in the past Debian users downloaded the packages and
    used them carelessly to get brand-new versions. This led to a lot of support
    questions. So we decided to just keep the source packages.
    {% endblocktrans %}
</p>

<h3>
    {% blocktrans trimmed %}
    How long will it take until my upload is available to sponsors?
    {% endblocktrans %}
</h3>

<p>
    {% blocktrans trimmed %}
    If you upload via HTTP, which is what we recommend, then it will take
    between 0 and 2 minutes.
    {% endblocktrans %}
</p>

<p>
    {% blocktrans trimmed %}
    If you upload via FTP, which you must do if a package is too large for the
    HTTP uploader, then there can be up to a 30 minute delay before your package
    gets processed.
    {% endblocktrans %}
</p>

<p>
    {% blocktrans trimmed %}
    During those 0-2 minutes, the server does quality assurance and other checks
    on your package. You will receive an email when it is ready.
    {% endblocktrans %}
</p>

<h2>{% trans 'Information for sponsors' %}</h2>

<h3>{% trans 'What is a sponsor?' %}</h3>

<p>
    {% blocktrans trimmed %}
    Someone who uploads the package and is responsible for the package in the
    archive. The sponsor is responsible for the quality of the package and
    checks the work of the package maintainer to improve his skills.
    {% endblocktrans %}
</p>

<h3>{% trans 'Why should I sponsor uploads' %}</h3>

<p>
    {% blocktrans trimmed %}
    Thanks for your interest. There are a lot of sponsorees waiting for a
    Developer to help them with their packages, and if you want to help with the
    New Maintainer process this is a good step to get involved.
    {% endblocktrans %}
</p>

<h3>{% trans 'What to do for sponsoring?' %}</h3>

<p>
    {% blocktrans trimmed %}
    Look for packages that you would like to sponsor on this website. Once you
    have found some you should download, build and test them. Please notify your
    sponsoree of every problem that you find in order to give him a chance to
    fix them. We believe that it is of uttermost importance to stay in contact
    with your sponsorees to keep them interested in working on Debian. Moreover,
    they will also learn how to maintain packages within a team and will learn
    skills that are crucial for Debian Developers more easily.
