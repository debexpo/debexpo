<h1>{% trans 'The sponsoring process' %}</h1>

<p>
    {% blocktrans trimmed %}
    As sponsored maintainer you do not have upload permissions to the Debian
    repository. Therefore you have three possibilities to get your package
    into Debian:
    {% endblocktrans %}
</p>

<ul>
    <li>{% trans 'Join a packaging team' %}</li>
    <li>{% trans 'Ask the <tt>debian-mentors</tt> mailing list' %}</li>
    <li>
        {% trans 'Talk directly to people willing to sponsor your package' %}
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    {% blocktrans with url_review=url_intro_review trimmed %}
    A sponsor, regardless of how you found one will
    <a href="{{ url_review }}">review</a> your package.  Everyone is
    invited to review packages, including yourself. We encourage you to
    review other people's packages - both of you will benefit.
    {% endblocktrans %}
</p>

<h2>{% trans 'Join a packaging team' %}</h2>

<p>
    {% blocktrans trimmed %}
    There are teams in Debian who maintain packages collaboratively. If your
    package deals with libraries for programming languages or is part of an
    ecosystem of associated packages, think of KDE or Gnome packages for
    example, you may want to join the respective team. Have a look at the
    <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/Teams/#Packaging_teams">(incomplete)
    list of packaging teams</a> in Debian.
    {% endblocktrans %}
</p>

<p>
    {% blocktrans trimmed %}
    Please note, each of those teams may have their own workflows and
    policies covering how to deal with package uploads. Contact their
    respective mailing lists and home pages to learn more.
    {% endblocktrans %}
</p>

<h2>{% trans 'File a RFS bug against the <tt>sponsorship-requests</tt> pseudo-package' %}</h2>

<p>
    {% blocktrans with site_name=settings.SITE_NAME trimmed %}
    If your package does not match the interests of any team or you are not sure
    whether a team could be interested in your package, please report a bug
    against <tt><a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?pkg=sponsorship-requests">sponsorship-requests</a></tt>
    pseudo-package to draw attention to your package. Your bug report should be
    formatted according to our RFS ("<em>request for sponsorship</em>")
    template. If you uploaded your package to {{ site_name }}, a
    RFS template can be shown on your package page.
    {% endblocktrans %}

    <em>If you are unsure or in doubt, choose this alternative</em>.

    {% blocktrans trimmed %}
    Typically you will reach the greatest audience by filing a bug. Eventually
    also some non-uploading reviewer may have a look at your package. Please do
    not worry if you get no answer: It happens from time to time that all
    interested people might be distracted or busy. It does not mean your package
    is bad. Feel free to post a follow-up message after a few weeks or try any
    of the alternative methods to find a sponsor.
    {% endblocktrans %}
</p>

<h2>{% trans 'Finding a sponsor' %}</h2>

<p>
    {% blocktrans trimmed %}
    If you want, you can contact sponsors willing to upload packages of other
    maintainers directly. <em>Please do not send out mass emails!</em> Instead
    watch out for their individual requirements and guidelines. Contact
    individuals only if your package is compatible to their respective
    requirements and matches their area of interest. To tell apart sponsors who
    are interested in your package from those who are not, we asked developers
    to formulate their own sponsor traits. Please read them carefully and
    compare your package with their expectations.
    {% endblocktrans %}
</p>

<p>
    {% blocktrans trimmed %}
    Similarly, you can also try to get in touch with other package maintainers
    directly. This makes sense if you prepared a package which extends the
    functionality of a related package in a useful way or can be used together.
    Consider you packaged log analysis tool for a web server, the maintainer of
    that web server might be interested to sponsor you. If you consider to
    contact a maintainer of such a related package directly, make sure he is
    actually able to sponsor you. Remember: Only Debian Developer are allowed to
    sponsor packages. You can identify developers by looking up their name at
    <a href="https://db.debian.org/">db.debian.org</a>.
    {% endblocktrans %}
</p>

<h2>{% trans 'Sponsor guidelines' %}</h2>

<p>
    {% blocktrans trimmed %}
    To help you find a sponsor interested in your package, they can formulate
    sponsor traits for either social or technical aspects. Additionally a
    sponsor may not usually be interested in every package but only in a certain
    category.
