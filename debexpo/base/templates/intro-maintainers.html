    Introduction for maintainers: How will my package get into Debian

</h1>

<p>
    {% blocktrans trimmed %}
    We are glad that you found your way to our web site. Honestly, the whole web
    site is just there to get your work into Debian. Your contribution is
    appreciated and it would be a pity if you did not find a sponsor to upload
    your packages. Read on to see in what ways we will be helping you find a
    sponsor.
    {% endblocktrans %}
</p>

<h2>{% trans '1. Find a requested package' %}</h2>

<p>
    {% blocktrans with u_sponsor=url_sponsor trimmed %}
    Debian is a distribution, not a general purpose repository. Many of us do
    not believe <em>every</em> piece of free software necessarily belongs in
    Debian. Please do not treat Debian as a platform to advertise your own
    software, unless there is some <em>real</em> request for it. That said,
    there is no one who ultimately judges about that. Eventually you may get
    some feedback on that discussion after filing your WNPP bug (see below)
    however you are free to interpret that as a suggestion, not as a final vote.
    After all, you need to find a sponsor believing in the benefit of having
    your package in Debian. Please have a look at our
    <a href="{{ u_sponsor }}">sponsors page</a> to learn about personal
    interests of sponsors.
    {% endblocktrans %}
</p>

<p>
    {% blocktrans trimmed %}
    If you want to contribute to Debian, but you do not know which packages to
    contribute to, take a look at "Request for help" (<em>RFH</em>), "Request
    for adopter" (<em>RFA</em>), "Orphaned package" (<em>O</em>) and "Request
    for package" (<em>RFP</em>) bugs. See <em>WNPP</em> below.

<h2>{% trans '2. File a WNPP bug' %}</h2>

<p>
    {% blocktrans trimmed %}
    <a href="https://www.debian.org/devel/wnpp/">
        Work-Needing and Prospective Packages</a> (<em>WNPP</em>) is our system
    of announcing your intent to markup packages being worked on. In particular
    it is a bug against the
    <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?pkg=wnpp">
        WNPP pseudo package</a>
    (<a href="https://wnpp.debian.net/">or use a nice frontend</a> to browse
    <em>WNPP</em> bugs). If you want to package something not currently
    available in Debian, the very first step should be to file an "Intent to
    package" (<em>ITP</em>) bug against <em>WNPP</em>. You may want to use the
    <tt><a href="https://packages.debian.org/sid/reportbug">reportbug</a></tt>
    tool to achieve that by selecting "<em>wnpp</em>" as package to report
    a bug to.

<h2>{% trans '3. Make the package' %}</h2>

    {% blocktrans trimmed %}
    Debian packages must comply to several normative requirements and
    guidelines. We can't give you exhaustive instructions on how to build
    packages here. In short, we expect you to provide a <em>source package</em>
    complying to the Debian policy at least (see below). Please take a look at

                {% blocktrans with title=settings.SITE_TITLE trimmed %}
                You can use <em>FTP</em> to upload packages to {{ title }}. If

<p>
    {% blocktrans trimmed %}
    If you did everything right, you will get a confirmation mail from our site
    and you can start seeking a sponsor for your package.
    {% endblocktrans %}
</p>

<h2>{% trans '5. Find a sponsor' %}</h2>

<p>
    {% blocktrans with title=settings.SITE_TITLE u_sponsor=url_sponsor trimmed %}
    Once your package is publicly available on any resource, including but not
    limited to {{ title }} you may start searching for a
    sponsor for your package. If you have already uploaded packages to Debian,
    you should ask your former sponsor. A sponsor is any
    <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianDeveloper">Debian Developer</a>
    willing to upload your package to Debian on your behalf. Have a look to our
    <a href="{{ u_sponsor }}">sponsors page</a>
    to learn more on sponsors and how to find one.
    {% endblocktrans %}
</p>

<p>
    {% blocktrans with u_reviewers=url_reviewers trimmed %}
    The main point of the sponsoring process is to review your package to make
    sure it meets our technical requirements. Everyone can and should review
    other people's packages. Also, a clean package will increase your likelihood
    to find a sponsor. Please take a look at our page
    <a href="{{ u_reviewers }}">about package reviews</a>.
    {% endblocktrans %}
</p>

<h3>{% trans 'The relation between you and your sponsor' %}</h3>

<p>
    {% blocktrans trimmed %}
    A sponsor is not technically responsible for your package.
    <strong>You</strong> will be listed as the official maintainer of the
    package in Debian. You will even get the bug reports if people discover
    problems in your package. Apart from not being able to upload the package
    directly into Debian you are treated as a full member of the community. The
    Debian project appreciates the work you do.
    {% endblocktrans %}
</p>

<h3>{% trans "What can I do if I don't find a sponsor?" %}</h3>

<p>
    {% blocktrans trimmed %}
    Do not give up. Sponsoring can take a while. Nonetheless, here are a few
    hints:
    {% endblocktrans %}
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        {% blocktrans trimmed %}
        File a follow-up request to your existing <em>sponsorship-requests</em>
        pseudo-package.
        {% endblocktrans %}
    </li>
    <li>
        {% blocktrans with u_sponsor=url_sponsor trimmed %}
        Offer your package directly to relevant teams and individual developers.
        We made a <a href="{{ u_sponsor }}">list of sponsors</a>
        , eventually willing to upload packages for you. <em>Please don't
        contact every sponsor listed there. Instead, read their individual
        requirements and choose the sponsor which matches you and your package
        best</em>.
        {% endblocktrans %}
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>{% trans '6. Getting an upload to Debian' %}</h2>

<p>
    {% blocktrans trimmed %}
    Once you find a sponsor interested in your package, he or she will
    <em>sponsor</em> it. That means reviewing, building, and testing it and then
    uploading it to Debian. You will get notified by <em>dak</em> - the software
    used by Debian to manage its repositories - about the upload. Please note,
    if your package was not at all in Debian before, it needs manual approval by
    <a href="https://ftp-master.debian.org/">ftpmasters</a> to clear the
    <a href="https://ftp-master.debian.org/new.html">NEW queue</a>. They will do
    consistency checks, and review your <tt>debian/copyright</tt> file whether
    your package matches the
    <a href="https://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines">
        Debian Free Software Guidelines</a>.
    ftpmaster's opinion is binding here for both your sponsor and you.
    {% endblocktrans %}
</p>

<h2>{% trans '7. Maintaining your package in Debian' %}</h2>

<p>
    {% blocktrans with name=settings.SITE_NAME u_sponsor=url_sponsor trimmed %}
    Please see the corresponding chapter in the
    <a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/maint-guide/update">
        New Maintainer's Guide</a> to get the idea. Whenever you feel like, you
    should update your package in Debian. The general procedure is not different
    from your first upload. Please upload your updated package to {{ name }} and
    notify your former sponsor about your change. Alternatively, follow
    <a href="{{ u_sponsor }}">the usual procedures</a>.
    {% endblocktrans %}
</p>

<p>
    {% blocktrans trimmed %}
    If your package passes through the sponsoring process for <em>a few</em>
    successive uploads without any notable correction by your sponsor, you can
    become a
    <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianMaintainer">Debian Maintainer</a>
    which grants you limited upload rights to Debian directly. Get in touch
    with your sponsor to discuss your chances here. You can also
    <a href="https://www.debian.org/devel/join/">become a Debian Developer</a>
    giving you full membership in the project.
    {% endblocktrans %}
