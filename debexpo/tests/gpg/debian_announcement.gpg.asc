Fellow Linuxers,

This is just to announce the imminent completion of a brand-new Linux release,
which I'm calling the Debian Linux Release.  This is a release that I have put
together basically from scratch; in other words, I didn't simply make some
changes to SLS and call it a new release.  I was inspired to put together this
release after running SLS and generally being dissatisfied with much of it,
and after much altering of SLS I decided that it would be easier to start
from scratch.  The base system is now virtually complete (though I'm still
looking around to make sure that I grabbed the most recent sources for
everything), and I'd like to get some feedback before I add the "fancy" stuff.

Please note that this release is not yet completed and may not be for several
more weeks; however, I thought I'd post now to perhaps draw a few people out
of the woodwork.  Specifically, I'm looking for:

        1) someone who will eventually be willing to allow me to upload the
                release to their anonymous ftp-site.  Please contact me.
                Be warned that it will be rather large :)

        2) comments, suggestions, advice, etc. from the Linux community.  This
                is your chance to suggest specific packages, series, or
                anything you'd like to see part of the final release.

Don't assume that because a package is in SLS that it will necessarily be
included in the Debian release!  Things like ls and cat are a given, but if
there's anything that's in SLS that you couldn't live without please let me
know!

I'd also like suggestions for specific features for the release.  For example,
a friend of mine here suggested that undesired packages should be selected
BEFORE the installation procedure begins so the installer doesn't have to
babysit the installation.  Suggestions along that line are also welcomed.

What will make this release better than SLS?  This:

        1) Debian will be sleeker and slimmer.  No more multiple binaries and
                manpages.
        2) Debian will contain the most up-to-date of everything.  The system
                will be easy to keep up-to-date with a 'upgrading' script in
                the base system which will allow complete integration of
                upgrade packages.
        3) Debian will contain a installation procedure that doesn't need to
                be babysat; simply install the basedisk, copy the distribution
                disks to the harddrive, answer some question about what
                packages you want or don't want installed, and let the machine
                install the release while you do more interesting things.
        4) Debian will contain a system setup procedure that will attempt to
                setup and configure everything from fstab to Xconfig.
        5) Debian will contain a menu system that WORKS... menu-driven
                package installation and upgrading utility, menu-driven
                system setup, menu-driven help system, and menu-driven
                system administration.
        6) Debian will make Linux easier for users who don't have access to the
                Internet.  Currently, users are stuck with whatever comes with
                SLS.  Non-Internet users will have the option of receiving
                periodic upgrade packages to apply to their system.  They will
                also have the option of selecting from a huge library of
                additional packages that will not be included in the base
                system.  This library will contain packages like the S3
                X-server, nethack and Seyon; basically packages that you and I
                can ftp but non-netters cannot access.
        7) Debian will be extensively documented (more than just a few
                READMEs).
        8) As I put together Debian, I am keeping a meticulous record of
                where I got everything.         This will allow the end-user to
                not only know where to get the source, but whether or not
                the most recent version is a part of Debian.  This record
                will help to keep the Debian release as up-to-date as possible.
        9) Lots more, but I'll detail later...

Anyway, I'll provide more specifics in a week or so after I receive enough
replies.

Please, all replies by mail.  I'll post a followup.  If you wish to discuss
this in the newsgroup, please don't turn it into a flamewar. :)

Until later,

Ian
