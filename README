running debexpo
===============

First, create a virtualenv.

  % sudo apt-get install python-virtualenv
  % virtualenv .

This creates a virtual Python environment in which you can install the
dependencies for debexpo without altering your system (i.e., without
requiring root). Once you have the virtualenv set up, run this command to
download the dependencies and set up the debexpo code so it can be run:

  % ./bin/python setup.py develop

You might think you are done, but wait! You have to compile the
translations from "PO" format into "MO" format. To do that:

  % ./bin/python setup.py build_i18n

Hooray! Now you're ready to run the automated tests. (The code for the
tests lives in debexpo/tests/*. This is a test suite; you can read more at
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_suite .)

  % ./bin/nosetests --with-pylons=test.ini

If all is well, all the tests should pass. Then you know you're ready to
develop.

Note that as of this writing (2010-10-04) they do not all pass. That means
there is work to do!

debexpo documentation
=====================

The debexpo documentation is being stored in restructured text inside the
docs/ directory. You can find the current installation guide at
docs/installing.rst. You should build and view the html docs by executing:

  % sudo apt-get install python-sphinx # needed to build the docs
  % cd docs/
  % make html
  % sensible-browser .build/html/index.html
