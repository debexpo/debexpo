Contributing
============

Help is always welcome in debexpo. There are also a number of ways
to contribute:

* `Fixing bugs <http://debexpo.workaround.org/trac/report/1>`_
* Testing the software and filing bugs
* Filing wishlist bugs
* Implementing new features
* Writing new plugins

Getting the source
==================

You can clone the Git repository using::

    git clone git://git.debian.org/debexpo/debexpo.git

How we use branches
===================

Contributions to Debexpo should be based on the "master" branch. This is
the default when you clone the repository.

We recommend rebasing your work so that it is based on the latest "origin/master"
just before you submit the changes for review.

We also use the branch name *live* to indicate what is running on the main site.

Where to send patches
=====================

You should send patches or any other feedback and information to the
`debexpo-devel <http://workaround.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/debexpo-devel>`_
mailing list.

We also welcome Git branches.
