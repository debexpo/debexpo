    * Support for sponsoring guidelines. Debian Developer are asked to register at
      mentors.debian.net (if not done already) and provide there their personal
      sponsoring guidelines. That's is a semi-structured description text to
      point sponsors to individual developers who are interested to sponsor some
      packages.

    * Provide worker tasks which run background jobs on the Expo server. Aside of
      this technical detail, this has the visible effect to our users that
      packages are automatically being removed from mentors.debian.net if:

          + The package was uploaded to an official Debian archive
          + The package did not find a sponsor within 12 weeks. You can always
            reupload the package before, or after it is being removed from Expo to
            reset the timer.

    * Provide public profile pages for both, maintainer and developers. For
      maintainer their package list is being displayed among their profile data.
      On the other hand, for Debian Developers their sponsoring guidelines are
      being displayed.
      Both can disable their profiles if desired.
