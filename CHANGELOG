debexpo (UNRELEASED + 1)

    * Support for sponsoring guidelines. Debian Developer are asked to register at
      mentors.debian.net (if not done already) and provide there their personal
      sponsoring guidelines. That's is a semi-structured description text to
      point sponsors to individual developers who are interested to sponsor some
      packages.

    * Provide public profile pages for both, maintainer and developers. For
      maintainer their package list is being displayed among their profile data.
      On the other hand, for Debian Developers their sponsoring guidelines are
      being displayed.
      Both can disable their profiles if desired.



debexpo (UNRELEASED)

    * Remove identification of uploads by upload hash. This should never have
      been implemented that way. Instead verify the GnuPG for uploader. Please
      check your GnuPG key in your profile, your key ID must match your
      changed-by uploader ID, otherwise Debexpo will reject your upload. This
      behavior is the same for both, HTTP and FTP uploads.
      You can, but you do not need to update your ~/.dput.cf if you used to use
      HTTP. However, The upload hash is not used anymore.
      n.b.: It can take several hours until a new key is added to the mentors
      keyring


    * Provide worker tasks which run background jobs on the Expo server. Aside of
      this technical detail, this has the visible effect to our users that
      packages are automatically being removed from mentors.debian.net if:

          + The package was uploaded to an official Debian archive
          + The package did not find a sponsor within 12 weeks. You can always
            reupload the package before, or after it is being removed from Expo to
            reset the timer.


    * Fix a bug in the orig.tar.gz handling (again). Make sure, the orig.tar.gz can
      be overwritten if the user uploaded a tarball which does not match the MD5 sum
      of an already known orig.tar.gz

    * Run the QA plugin again, link to the PTS page if the package is in Debian already.
      Thanks Andrew Starr-Bochicchio for providing a patch

    * Provide the correct RSS feed URL in the packages index page and fix HTML
      display issues on the same page.
      Thanks Paul Wise for providing a patch

    * Make comments (and other pre-formatted texts flow properly in the browser).
      Again, thanks Paul Wise and Sasa Bozic for telling us console hackers how
      pure vain graphical interfaces need to be designed.

    * Allow uploads to oldstable-security and fix a substantial amount of bugs
      causing the importer to crash previously.

    * For those who didn't notice yet: mentors.debian.net now supports SSL.
