    * Support for sponsoring guidelines. Debian Developer are asked to register at
      mentors.debian.net (if not done already) and provide there their personal
      sponsoring guidelines. That's is a semi-structured description text to
      point sponsors to individual developers who are interested to sponsor some
      packages.

    * Provide worker tasks which run background jobs on the Expo server. Aside of
      this technical detail, this has the visible effect to our users that
      packages are automatically being removed from mentors.debian.net if:

          + The package was uploaded to an official Debian archive
          + The package did not find a sponsor within 12 weeks. You can always
            reupload the package before, or after it is being removed from Expo to
            reset the timer.

    * Provide public profile pages for both, maintainer and developers. For
      maintainer their package list is being displayed among their profile data.
      On the other hand, for Debian Developers their sponsoring guidelines are
      being displayed.
      Both can disable their profiles if desired.


    * Fix a bug in the orig.tar.gz handling (again). Make sure, the orig.tar.gz can
      be overwritten if the user uploaded a tarball which does not match the MD5 sum
      of an already known orig.tar.gz

    * Run the QA plugin again, link to the PTS page if the package is in Debian already.
      Thanks Andrew Starr-Bochicchio for providing a patch


    * Provide the correct RSS feed URL in the packages index page and fix HTML
      display issues on the same page.
      Thanks Paul Wise for providing a patch

    * Make comments (and other pre-formatted texts flow properly in the browser).
      Again, thanks Paul Wise and Sasa Bozic for telling us console hackers how
      pure vain graphical interfaces need to be designed.
